# XSwitcher

**Auto-switch keyboard layouts based on the active application.**

**XSwitcher** is a lightweight CLI tool that launches programs using different keyboard layouts depending on what you're working on. Great for bilingual users, coders, or anyone who needs to switch layouts on the fly.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÅ Automatically switches between **main** and **secondary** layouts
- ‚öôÔ∏è Simple config file for layout preferences
- üß† Stays out of your way‚Äîjust run and focus

```

## Compatibility

- Works with Steams `%command%` launch option:
``` bash
xswitcher %command%

- Works with any app that constantly runs. It will not work with apps such as **VSCode** due to that it makes a new process every time
